# Data Science & Python: Web Scraping Disney Movies
This program scrapes info from Wikipedia about all the Disney Movies. Then, I clean the data and sort them out. I create a pandas DataFrame where I can perform different analysis to find which movie is the longest, shortest, highest/lowest box office/budget, etc.

Tech stack: Python, Pandas
